# PoGoSever

The PoGoServer project, or Pokemon Go Server, is an effort reverse engineer the backend pokemon go game servers and make our own that will work seamilessly (hopefully) with the Offical app, and 3rd party clients alike with a long term goal of extending the functionalaity of the game.

Django was choose because it is quick, easy to learn, and seemed like it wouild work well for this project.


# Long Term Goals
- extend game functionality (trading, real breeding, pvp, etc)
- Dockerize the django app
- create a way to import player data from an offical pokemon go account
